
## Data Structures
  > A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.
## Algorithm
  > An algorithm can be defined as a finite set of steps, which has to be followed while carrying out a particular problem. It is nothing but a process of executing actions step by step.
